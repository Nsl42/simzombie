SimZombie is a Java package designed to simulate epidemics, specifically those of zombie, vampire and werewolf "outbreaks".  It is based on the mathematical model presented in 'When Zombies Attack!: Mathematical Modelling of an Outbreak of Zombie Infection' by Munz et al., which is based on the SIR Infectivity Model.

Parameters of the simulation include the speed at which the infected are capable of moving, the size of the environment and initial population, the chance that susceptibles fight back against the 'monsters', etc.

SimZombie was developed by Matthew Crossley, a PhD student in the Novel Computation Group at Manchester Metropolitan University.  For more information about Matthew, please visit http://www.matthewcrossley.com
